# Hi there 👋

I am Quelopande, a junior web developer who has been programming for 3 years with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL. Currently, I am expanding my skills by learning **Node.js** and **Flutter**. My journey in the tech industry began 3 years ago when I started as a web developer. Since then, I have been passionately coding, debugging, and deploying websites, gaining valuable experience along the way. My dedication to continuous learning and my passion for coding make me an asset in the tech industry.
