## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Quelopande, a junior web developer who has been programming for two year with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL. Currently, I am expanding my skills by learning node.js, and SQL, with a particular focus on MySQL. My journey in the tech industry began a year ago when I started as a web developer. Since then, I have been passionately coding, debugging, and deploying websites, gaining valuable experience along the way. My dedication to continuous learning and my passion for coding make me an asset in the tech industry. As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, thereâ€™s no doubt that I will make significant contributions to the field.
